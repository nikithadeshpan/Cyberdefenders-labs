# WebStrike – Network Forensics Investigation (CyberDefenders)

## Lab Overview
**WebStrike** is a network forensics challenge on the CyberDefenders platform designed to simulate a real-world web server compromise. 
In this lab, you analyze a provided PCAP file using Wireshark to investigate:
- how an attacker uploaded a malicious web shell,
- evidence of reverse shell communication,
- and potential data exfiltration. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

#Tools Used
- **Wireshark** — packet analysis
- Protocol filtering (HTTP, TCP streams)
- Network endpoint statistics

# Investigation Summary

##1 Initial Traffic Assessment
- Loaded the PCAP in Wireshark.
- Applied filters (e.g., `http`, `tcp`) to isolate relevant traffic.
- Looked for abnormal HTTP POST requests suggestive of file uploads.

##2 Web Shell Detection
- Identified unusual HTTP requests that contained potential payloads.
- Examined the request paths and content to see if a shell upload occurred.

##3 Reverse Shell and C2 Behavior
- Followed suspicious TCP streams to identify possible reverse shell communication.
- Checked for extended TCP sessions not associated with normal web browsing.

##4 Exfiltration Investigation
- Reviewed outbound traffic for large transfers or unusual data flows.
- Correlated time frames with other suspicious activity.
